# AlexRentals — Frontend (Personalized)

Personalized frontend submission for Alex E. Mathew. Features:
- React + Vite scaffold
- Persistent favorites (localStorage)
- Search + max price filter + sorting (price/popularity)
- Booking modal + Bookings page (localStorage)
- Car details page and Contact page
- Theme toggle (dark brown theme with light-peach fonts; light sky-blue theme with dark-blue fonts)
- Images: place your car images in `src/images/1.png` .. `src/images/5.png`

Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Do not include node_modules when submitting; use `.gitignore` to exclude it.
- The `src/images` folder is intentionally empty here; add your PNGs later.
